Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

## Data Analysis
-----
* Observed that the trendline steadily decreases for maximum temperatures on the nothern hemisphere as we go further north from the equator
* Observed that the trendline steadily increases for maximum temperatures on the southern hemisphere as we go further north towards the equator
* Latitude has very minimal effect on Humidity and Cloudiness
## Reasoning
-----
* It is hot near the equator and as we go towards the north pole the maximum temperature decreases. We see this very clearly from our maximum temperature vs northern hemisphere linear regression analysis
* Similarly it is hot near the equator and we go towards the south pole the maximum temperature decreases. We see this very clearly from our maximum temperatures vs southern hemisphere linear regression analysis
* brrrrrr .. it is very cold at the poles. brrrrrr!!
* Humidity and cloudiness seems to not have much affect on latitude evident from our analysis. They depend on multiple factors like pressure, temperature and windspeed.
